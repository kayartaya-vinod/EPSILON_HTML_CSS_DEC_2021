            <h3>Lion</h3>
            <p>
                The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera
                native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested
                body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the
                end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are
                larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social
                species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists
                of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of
                female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large
                ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although
                some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known
                to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas, shrublands and dry
                deciduous forests. It is usually more diurnal than other wild
                cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night
                and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged
                throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western
                and South Asia, but it has been reduced to fragmented
                populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western
                India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List
                since 1996 because populations in African countries have
                declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations
                are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the
                cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and
                conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human
                culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures
                and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and
                literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of
                the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for
                exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late
                18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in
                Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all
                ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current
                range.

        <div id="Tiger">
            <h3>Tiger</h3>
            <p>
                The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species
                and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for
                its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.
                An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer
                and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but
                social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat,
                which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its
                offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two
                years, then become independent and leave their mother's home
                range to establish their own.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once
                ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to
                the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the
                foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since
                the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93%
                of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western
                and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large
                areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today, the tiger's
                range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests
                to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent,
                Indochina and Sumatra.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of
                2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number
                between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the
                populations living in small isolated pockets. India currently
                hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population
                decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and
                poaching. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict,
                particularly in range countries with a high human population
                density.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the
                world's charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in the
                ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its
                historic range, and continues to be depicted in modern films and
                literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as
                mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of
                India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.

        <div id="Eagle">
            <h3>Eagle</h3>
            <p>
                Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with heavy
                heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted
                eagle (Aquila pennata), which is comparable in size to a common
                buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have
                relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct,
                faster flight – despite the reduced size of aerodynamic
                feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart
                from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the South
                Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (1 lb) and 40
                cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like all
                birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping
                flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful
                talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other
                birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is
                estimated that the martial eagle, whose eyes are more than two
                times larger than the human eye, has a visual acuity up to 8
                times that of humans. This acuity enables eagles to spot
                potential prey from a very long distance.[2] This keen eyesight
                is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which
                ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light.
                The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the
                male.[3][4]
            </p>
            <p>
                Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees
                or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older,
                larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has
                hatched. The parents take no action to stop the killing.[5][6]
                The dominant chick tends to be a female, as they are bigger than
                the male. It is said that eagles fly above clouds but this is
                not true. Eagles fly during storms and glide from the winds
                pressure. This saves the bird's energy. Due to the size and
                power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the
                food chain as apex predators in the avian world. The type of
                prey varies by genus. The Haliaeetus and Ichthyophaga eagles
                prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often
                capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are
                powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent
                eagles of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis
                predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the
                tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus Aquila are
                often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any
                medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where Aquila eagles are
                absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested
                buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top
                raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including
                the species-rich genus Spizaetus, live predominantly in
                woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various
                arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often
                unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments.
                Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with
                some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques
                based on their environment and prey at any given time. Most
                eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the
                prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.[7]
            </p>
            <p>
                The bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load
                verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew
                with a 6.8 kg (15 lb) mule deer fawn.[8] However, a few eagles
                may target prey considerably heavier than themselves; such prey
                is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of
                the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest. Golden and
                crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg (66
                lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker, 7–8
                times heavier than the preying eagle.[7][9] Authors on birds
                David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the
                behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of
                prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared
                to other North American raptors):[10]

                from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the South
                Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (1 lb) and 40
                cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like all
                birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping
                flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful
                talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other
                birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is
                estimated that the martial eagle, whose eyes are more than two
                times larger than the human eye, has a visual acuity up to 8
                times that of humans. This acuity enables eagles to spot
                potential prey from a very long distance.[2] This keen eyesight
                is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which
                ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light.
                The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the
                male.[3][4]

                Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees
                or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older,
                larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has
                hatched. The parents take no action to stop the killing.[5][6]
                The dominant chick tends to be a female, as they are bigger than
                the male. It is said that eagles fly above clouds but this is
                not true. Eagles fly during storms and glide from the winds
                pressure. This saves the bird's energy. Due to the size and
                power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the
                food chain as apex predators in the avian world. The type of
                prey varies by genus. The Haliaeetus and Ichthyophaga eagles
                prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often
                capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are
                powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent
                eagles of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis
                predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the
                tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus Aquila are
                often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any
                medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where Aquila eagles are
                absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested
                buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top
                raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including
                the species-rich genus Spizaetus, live predominantly in
                woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various
                arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often
                unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments.
                Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with
                some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques
                based on their environment and prey at any given time. Most
                eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the
                prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.[7]

                The bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load
                verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew
                with a 6.8 kg (15 lb) mule deer fawn.[8] However, a few eagles
                may target prey considerably heavier than themselves; such prey
                is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of
                the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest. Golden and
                crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg (66
                lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker, 7–8
                times heavier than the preying eagle.[7][9] Authors on birds
                David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the
                behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of
                prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared
                to other North American raptors):[10]

                Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with heavy
                heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted
                eagle (Aquila pennata), which is comparable in size to a common
                buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have
                relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct,
                faster flight – despite the reduced size of aerodynamic
                feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart
